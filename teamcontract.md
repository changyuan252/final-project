# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** we are going to meet at least twice a week, such as Tuesday and Friday night in order to discuss our works individually.Each meeting should no longer than 2 hours, normally our meeting holds 1 hour. In addition, group video of Wechat and Zoom are two tools that we will use for our meeting, however,  noneone is recroding video but we all taking note ofinformations that can help us to accomplish goals later on of our final Project.

2. **Assistance**  we are going to use cellphone or Wechat to contact each other during this project to discuss our topics or solve the problem we encounter during the task. From my perspective, I would reply these texts within 30 mins.

3. **Respect** At first, we all should know how to respect to other group memebers. Paying attention when others talking and give some personal idea if necessary. I would make sure we are stay in an quite place to discuss our problem. when we have discussed something important, people should ask question to each other. When one person is expressing his or her opinion, the others should be silent. When this discussion is over, we all can speak freely. Meanwhile, everyone has to present their own ideas every time.
## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution**  All team members should take an active part in this project, and each member can focus on their best area. In this team, someone needs to concult and collect efficient data(Kang), someone should with excellent coding ability(Yuan) and high flexibility in logic, someone needs to check code and debug error code(Zhang). It also needs someone to seek help and solve the problem in time(Kang). I don't care about everyone's working hours, but all team member should submit or contribute something during their weekly report or meeting. Meanwhile, we can change our roles weekly (adopting mutual ideas and exchanging work).This method can effectively make every member of my team familiar with and deeply understand this project.

5. **Time Commitment** We decide that each team member would work about 12 hours per week, or at least an hour per day on average. we need to determine the next time allocation and tasks at the last meeting of each week, so that we can ensure the progress of our plan in advance. If there is an urgent problem, we can reduce the workload a little, but we need to increase our work flow in the following week to ensure that our schedule is not delayed.

6. **Conflict Resolution** We decided to adopt a voting system to take members' best idea and resolve differnt ideas. we need to respect and understand different issues and ensure there exists fairness and justice within our team. Hence, voting system is particularly important(majority rule). If we need to discuss problems ahead or can't complete our tasks this week, we need to inform other team members in advance. At end of each week's final meeting, we should estimate our general tasks for next week.
